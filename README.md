Supply Chain Process Mining & Data Analysis - WoodCorp Case Study

**Capstone Project | Celonis Academic Alliance | Top 3 Finalist**

This project was part of an academic capstone initiative where we partnered with **Celonis** to perform process mining and data analysis on the **Order-to-Cash (O2C)** process of a fictional company: **WoodCorp Inc.** The challenge was to identify inefficiencies in their supply chain and propose data-backed solutions using **Celonis EMS**.



Overview

**Company:** WoodCorp Inc.  
**Sector:** Wooden pallets & boxes manufacturing  
**Locations:** Multiple warehouses (automated and non-automated)  
**Dataset:** Celonis-provided event logs and order data (O2C)  
**Goal:** Improve On-Time Delivery (OTD) to â‰¥ 80% and reduce late delivery penalties  

---

Objectives

- Visualize and analyze the complete Order-to-Cash process
- Identify key delay factors and inefficiencies
- Develop a business case to highlight potential cost savings
- Provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards

---

Key Insights

- **Total Deliveries:** 19,953  
- **Late Deliveries:** 6,865 (OTD rate: 65.59%)  
- **Annual Loss:** â‚¬1.75M due to late deliveries  
- **Automation Impact:** 99.8% of late deliveries are from non-automated warehouses  
- **High-Impact Locations:** Essen (â‚¬1.18M in fees) and Aachen (â‚¬445K)  
- **Seasonal Trends:** Peak delays in May (806) and June (782)
